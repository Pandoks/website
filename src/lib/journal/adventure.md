We read fairy tales of heroes embarking on adventures. Struggling through hardship, emerging
victoriously, and also failing miserably. People resonate with these stories because we like to live
vicariously through these fictional characters. Good stories make the reader empathize and relate
to characters, and we like to daydream of the what if's. What if I was a hero too? But just like how
in fairy tales, heroes embark on adventures through a calling, you must listen to your own call to
adventure and take action. An adventure that you really resonate with. An adventure that you truly
want and not something that you've convinced yourself you want because of other people. Be selfish.
Listen to your inner flame and fuel it with everything you got.
