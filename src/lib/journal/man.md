The difference between successful people and you isn't as big as you think. Steve Jobs once said,
"everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you"
which juxtaposes Marcus Aurelius's "memento homo", "you are only a man". The quote that elevates
you to take down the gods has the same meaning as the quote that bring gods down to Earth. That is
"YOU ARE A HUMAN".
