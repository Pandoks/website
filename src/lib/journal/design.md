Recently, I've been pretty inspired by a lot of interior designers and it got me to think about
my own branding and what I want to build in the future. I used to be very engineer based where I
soley focused on making things work, seeing the beauty in "ugly" contraptions that worked
marvelously, but recently, I've been really getting in touch with art.

I've always enjoyed art, but I guess I just went on a really long side quest into engineering and
made the venture back home. I've gained a different perspective though. True art is when great
engineering meets art.

A great example of this is Porsche. Their cars are the pinnacle of mechanical engineering, yet
their cars themselves are also pieces of timeless art.

I've been thinking about the best and most beautiful product companies: Apple, Porsche, Ferrari.
What do they all have in common when it comes down to their design philosphy? How do they
consistently design pieces of art without compromising the utility from great engineering?

I came up with this equation:

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}utility_{i}}{n}\ni\substack{
utility_{i}=utility\ of\ feature\ i\\
n=number\ of\ features}
$$

In summary, you want to maximize this ratio. Maximize utility using the least amount of features as
possible
