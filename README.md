## Cool Easter Eggs

### Auto updating links

Checkout [pandoks.com/journal](https://pandoks.com/journal). Your URL will automatically change
based off of which journal entry you're reading so all you have to do is `<meta> + <l>` and
`<meta> + <c>` to share the entry.

### Vim

`y` will automatically copy the URL.

`hjkl` for navigating throughout the website.

`<enter>` to click

_If you use your mouse for anything, you'll lose your spot_
